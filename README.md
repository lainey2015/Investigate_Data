# Investigate_Data

The original data contains duplicated rows and irrelevent columns for analysis such as 'imdb_id', 'homepage', 'tagline', 'keywords','production_companies','overview', 'release_date' are not useful for analysis: to be dropped. These columns and rows were removed. In addition, the entries in which the budget value or revenues equal zero are misleading for analysis, and therefore, together with the outlier entries, all were removed. Then, 3715 entries were selected for analysis. Correlation among each numerical variables demonstrated that popularity and budget correlate deeper with revenues since the correlation rates were close to value 1 compared with other variables. Further analysis through calculation and visualization showed that the year had the highest year revenue was 2015, followed by 2012 while the lowest was 1966. The reason can be revealed by revisiting the situations and movie market analysis can be done further. Furthermore, animation movies brought the highest revenue but also with the highest budget. Among all, science fiction is the most popular movie genre. Over the time, action, drama and comedy movies have been released increasingly, specifically since the middle of the1980s. Beyond those, TV movies created the highest profit among all genres.
